# How confident do you feel with the content on arrays so far?
* I feel somewhat confident with the content so far but I still have a lot of questions
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
* I think I just need to spend a little more time actually using the array methods so that I can fully understand their functions. Other than that I feel ready to move on.
# What questions do you have about arrays?
All of my questions derive from methods. One big question I have is when I used a new method shuffle to try and shuffle my random_floats variable. I tried to print the newly shuffled variable but all that was printed was the floats in original order.
